Cordially welcome to a seminar by William Noble from University of Gothenburg on Wednesday 27th of January, at 13:15 online via Zoom. 

Title: "Distributional semantics for lexical variation and change".

Abstract: "Word representations based on the distributional hypothesis are useful in a wide range of natural language prediction tasks. They have also been used extensively to study long-term lexical semantic change. In this talk, I will discuss the use of distributional semantics to study more short-term semantic change, as well as variation between speech communities. I will present results from two recent studies and compare the merits of using word vectors from a diachronic Skip-Gram model versus conditional neural language models."

Time: 13.15-15.00
