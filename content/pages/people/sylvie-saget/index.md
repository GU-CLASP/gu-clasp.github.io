Sylvie Saget is a PhD/Doctoral Researcher in Computational Linguistics. Her research focuses on conversational agents that can talk and act autonomously such as virtual human, robots - or, generally speaking, any kind of object or system involving social interaction

PhD Project: "Language as a tool: A rational and cognitive approach"

Sylvie's approach is to refashion rationality starting from a distinction between two types of information (facts and infos related to what to do or use/how to behave) and the specification of corresponding information containers (epistemic mental attitude and memory-box). Based on this distinction regarding types of information & information-containers, she is developing a cognitive and rational approach of cognition, a rational dialog model as well as a cognitive architecture. Sylvie has a transdisciplinary approach mixing Artificial Intelligence with Philosophy of Mind, Formal Models, Cognitive and Social Psychology as well as Robotics.

Research interests: Social Cognition, Dialogue modeling/Pragmatics, Cognitive Agent, Language and Cognition, Philosophy of Mind, Design & Conception Methods, Ethics and AI
Topics: Conversational AI (dialog model, cognitive agent theory and architecture, design and conception methods). Study of acceptance as a doxatic state and its consequences on cognitive agency, Dialog and Conversational AI as well as technology acceptance.
