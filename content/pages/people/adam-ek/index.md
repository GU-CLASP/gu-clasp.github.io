I'm a PhD student at CLASP working on computational linguistics and neural networks. I'm interested in many aspects of language and machine learning, but my research focuses on using linguistic and extra-linguistic features to understand and improve NLP systems. In particular I'm interested in how different levels of linguistic analysis (morphological, syntactic, semantic, ...) can be used to improve the performance of NLP systems and their representations.
