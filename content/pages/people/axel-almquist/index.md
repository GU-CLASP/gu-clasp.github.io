I am a PhD student in computational Linguistics. In my research I aim to investigate the strength of different neural network architectures and linguistic representations in the task of identifying and linking segments in text.
Thus far I have been working on replicating Argument Mining studies and on building a framework to facilitate future research in segmentation and linking tasks.
